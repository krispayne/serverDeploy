# serverDeploy
script to deploy mac mini servers with some defaults

usage:

`$ chmod +x serverDeploy.sh`

`$ sudo ./serverDeploy.sh`

This isn't running as an imaging (tried at reboot) script in Casper. Running after first login from a `sudo jamf policy -trigger` works fine.


## Update 01/2018
This really should have been an anisble playbook. No one should use this.
